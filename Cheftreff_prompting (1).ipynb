            "The dataset comprises market survey data from various regions in the Syrian Arab Republic, focusing on factors such as MFIRiskLevel, MFIScore, and availability of goods. The average MFIScore across all regions is 7.07, indicating a moderate level of market functionality. Regions exhibit varying levels of risk, with some areas classified as Very High Risk and others as Low Risk. The average availability of goods is 6.94, suggesting a relatively stable supply chain in most regions.\n",

            "**Key Observations:**\n",
            "- The region of Homs shows the highest average MFIScore of 8.01, indicating a well-functioning market compared to other regions.\n",
            "- Rural Damascus has the highest average availability score of 8.33, indicating a consistent supply of goods in that area.\n",
            "- Market functionality in Aleppo is notably diverse, with some sub-regions scoring as low as 4.0 while others score a perfect 10.0.\n",
            "- Regions such as Idleb and Hama exhibit consistent low-risk profiles, with average MFIScores above 7.5 and minimal variation in risk levels.\n",
            "- The region of Deir-ez-Zor shows significant variability in MFIScores, ranging from 3.0 to 10.0, indicating localized market challenges.\n",
            "- There is a notable decrease in market resilience in regions surveyed in 2025 compared to those surveyed in 2023, with an average resilience score drop of 1.25 points.\n",
            "- The availability of goods in Quneitra has seen a significant increase of 3.75 points from the initial survey in 2023 to the latest survey in 2025.\n",
