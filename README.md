# Firing-the-Reportguy

Welcome to **Team_R**'s official submission for the **Cheftreff Hackathon**!


##  Project Overview

This project aims to automate the extraction, processing, summarization, and reporting of global market data such as commodity prices, market assessments, and exchange rates from the **WFP (World Food Programme)** website. 


## Features

-  Web scraping via Python for data extraction.
-  Data handling and analysis using CSV files.
-  Summary generation of CSV using LLM APIs.
-  Automatic PDF report generation from HTML.
-  FrontEnd Prototyping

### Components:

- **Front End**: User interface for interaction.
- **Python Scraping**: Extracts data from the WFP website.
- **CSV**: Stores structured data (market assessments, commodity prices, exchange rates).
- **LLM API + Matplotlib**: Analyzes and summarizes data(from csv files) + generates visual insights.
- **HTML Report Generator**: Converts data and visuals into a readable format.
- **HTML to PDF**: Finalizes report for download and distribution.

### Source Code for Prompt Engineering:
- Available at Cheftreff_prompting.ipynb
- Different Prompts were tested, including the whole dataset/including a summary and statistics of datasets in the prompt
