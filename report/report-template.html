    <li>With a population of approximately 18 million, Syria’s markets plunged from January 2023 to June 2023 as the average MFI score collapsed from 7.85 to 4.48, revealing acute supply-chain breakdowns and a surge in “Very High Risk” zones.</li>
    <li>Amid an economy that has contracted by over 60 % since 2011, the MFI score partially recovered from 4.48 in June 2023 to 6.42 by April 2024—yet this rebound is based on only four markets, offering a fragile illusion of stability.</li>
    <li>Against hyperinflation exceeding 200 % in 2023, price scores crashed from 8.5 in January 2023 to 1.9 in June 2023 before rebounding to 8.1 by April 2024, underscoring persistent volatility and the urgent need for diversified sourcing.</li>
    <li>Despite ongoing conflict since 2011 that’s ravaged infrastructure, resilience held relatively strong (~9.1 → 8.0 → 8.1) and availability stayed near-perfect (~10 → 9.6 → 10), highlighting that basic supply routes can endure extreme stress.</li>
    <li>With competition thinning (from 9.7 to 8.1 between Jan 2023 and Apr 2024), service scores stagnated at dangerously low levels (~6.5 → 4.2 → 4.2) and infrastructure ratings slid (~9.2 → 7.0), flagging monopolistic risks and the critical need for targeted investments to maintain customer trust."</li>

        <li>It’s brutal that global oil markets remain volatile, yet retail gas prices in Syrian markets skyrocketed by 718%, climbing from 22 000 SYP on 15 April 2024 to 180 000 SYP on 15 February 2025, threatening to cripple transport networks and humanitarian aid unless alternative logistics solutions are deployed.</li>
        <li>Given diesel powers generators and irrigation pumps across the country, its retail cost jumped 523%, surging from 2 007 SYP on 15 April 2024 to 12 500 SYP on 15 February 2025, risking severe disruption to farming operations and energy access—and forcing urgent diversification toward renewables.</li>
        <li>Considering bread is the backbone of Syrian diets, bakery prices surged 424%, rising from 554 SYP on 15 April 2024 to 2 900 SYP on 15 February 2025, shoving millions deeper into food insecurity and demanding an immediate scale-up of social safety nets.</li>
        <li>Since everyday commuting hinges on public buses, fares jumped 200%, from 1 000 SYP on 15 April 2024 to 3 000 SYP on 15 February 2025, slamming mobility for workers and displaced families—necessitating investment in affordable transport alternatives.</li>
        <li>With lentils serving as a primary protein source, prices actually dropped 40%, falling from 22 822 SYP on 15 April 2024 to 13 667 SYP on 15 February 2025, which might sound welcome but instead devastates local farmers’ livelihoods and calls for urgent support to stabilize agricultural incomes."</li>
